# Scout Skills — Development Guide

## Repo Location

`~/.claude/skills/scout/` — the git repo for the orchestrator.

Sub-skills live as **standalone directories** at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` and are **symlinked into scout** so they're shared.

## Structure

## How It Works

- Each skill is a **real directory** at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` — invokable standalone as `/<name>`
- Scout contains **relative symlinks** (`../reconn`, `../grill-me`, etc.) — making them also available as `/scout:<name>`
- Git tracks the symlinks, so cloning the repo preserves the link structure

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create the standalone skill: `~/.claude/skills/<new-skill>/SKILL.md`
2. Symlink it into scout:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/skills/scout
   ln -s ../<new-skill> <new-skill>
   ```
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add <new-skill> && git commit -m "feat: link <new-skill>" && git push origin main
   ```

## Editing Skills

Edit the **standalone directory** at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. Changes are visible through the symlink in scout automatically.

Note: only scout's own files (SKILL.md, settings.md, docs/, etc.) are tracked by git. The symlinked skills are tracked as symlink references, not file contents.

## Conventions

- **`settings.json` is gitignored** — user-specific runtime config.
- **Symlinks use relative paths** (`../reconn`) so the structure is portable.
- **Skills are independent** — removing a symlink from scout doesn't delete the standalone skill.
