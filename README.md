# Scout Skills

An agent orchestrator for Claude Code that takes ideas from concept to shipped PRs. Scout manages a roster of specialized, color-coded agents through a 4-phase pipeline: interrogation, PRD creation, issue breakdown, and parallel execution.

## What It Does

You give Scout a raw idea. It:

1. **Grills you** on the design until every decision is resolved (Reconn researches your codebase first)
2. **Writes a PRD** and submits it as a GitHub issue
3. **Estimates the cost** of implementation and lets you adjust scope or budget
4. **Breaks the PRD** into vertical-slice GitHub issues
5. **Executes every issue** in parallel — creating branches, implementing, testing, and opening PRs

The result is a set of verified, ready-to-merge pull requests.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Icon | Role | Runs In |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| **Scout** | 🟠 | Orchestrator — manages phases, state, handoffs | Original tab |
| **Griller** | 🔴 | Interviews user via `/grill-me` protocol | Scout tab |
| **Reconn** | 🟡 | Deep research — codebase, web, QMD, claude-mem | cmux tab |
| **Architect** | 🔵 | Writes PRD via `/write-a-prd` | cmux tab |
| **Bursar** | 💰 | Estimates token cost, presents budget options | Scout tab |
| **Slicer** | 🟣 | Breaks PRD into vertical-slice issues | cmux tab |
| **Builder-N** | 🟢 | Implements issues — one per parallel issue | cmux tab |
| **Designer** | 🩷 | UI design orchestrator for UI-heavy PRDs | cmux tab |

## Installation

### Quick install (symlinks — recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iykazrji/scout-skills.git
cd scout-skills

# Symlink all skills into Claude Code
for skill in skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$skill")
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$name
done
```

This installs all 7 skills at once. Symlinks mean `git pull` updates everything automatically.

### Manual install (copy)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iykazrji/scout-skills.git

# Copy all skills into Claude Code
for skill in scout-skills/skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$skill")
  cp -r "$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$name
done
```

### Verify installation

After installing, start a new Claude Code session and type `/scout` — you should see the skill activate.

## Usage

### Full pipeline

```bash
# Interactive mode (default) — approval gates at every phase
/scout Add a user profile API with avatar upload

# Yolo mode — you shape the design, then Scout builds everything
/scout --yolo Add real-time notifications with WebSocket support

# Auto mode — fully autonomous, skips grilling
/scout --auto Add pagination to the /users endpoint
```

### Standalone skills

```bash
# Deep research on a topic
/reconn How does authentication work in this project?

# Execute existing GitHub issues
/execute-issues

# Configure quality profile, execution mode, cmux preference
/scout:settings
```

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Grill | Approvals | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| `interactive` | Yes | All gates | Learning the system, high-stakes features |
| `yolo` | Yes | Grill only (last stop) | Day-to-day development — shape it, then ship it |
| `auto` | Skipped | None | Simple/well-defined tasks, batch work |

### Quality Profiles

Control cost vs quality by choosing which models agents use:

| Profile | Scout/Architect | Reconn/Slicer/Builders | Bursar |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| `high` | opus | opus | sonnet |
| `balanced` | opus | sonnet | sonnet |
| `budget` | sonnet | sonnet | haiku |

Configure with `/scout:settings` or directly in `~/.claude/skills/scout/settings.json`.

### Cost Estimation (Bursar)

After the PRD is written, the Bursar agent estimates the token cost of the remaining work and presents options:

- **Proceed** — continue with current profile and full scope
- **Scale down** — remove features to reduce cost
- **Budget mode** — switch to cheaper models
- **Both** — scale down and switch to budget mode

In `yolo` mode, Bursar auto-proceeds unless the estimate exceeds $10. In `auto` mode, it logs silently.

## Features

- **cmux integration** — auto-detects cmux and spawns color-coded tabs per agent
- **Technology detection** — auto-detects Flutter, React Native, Expo, Next.js, React, Express, Fastify and injects framework-specific best practices into every agent
- **Cost estimation** — Bursar estimates token spend before execution, with options to adjust
- **Three execution modes** — interactive, yolo (shape then ship), auto (fully autonomous)
- **Quality profiles** — high, balanced, budget — control cost vs capability per agent
- **Crash recovery** — resumes interrupted sessions from `/tmp/scout-state.json`
- **Failure recovery** — builders self-dispatch Reconn research agents on implementation failures
- **Wave-based parallel execution** — independent issues execute simultaneously
- **UI design pipeline** — optional Designer agent for UI-heavy PRDs with visual verification
